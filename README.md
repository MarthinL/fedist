A federated approach to process and data distribution

Over the years software engineering
disciplines and their tools had been
fertile grounds for the general
approach of solving complex problems by
recursively breaking them down into
ever simpler to solve sub-problems
where the combination of sub-solutions
constitutes a complete solution.
